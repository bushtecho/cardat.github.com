First we describe the approach to use a relational data model of linking files within datasets within projects. Files, Datasets and Projects in the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) schema is defined by the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity - KNB (https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#tools/eml). A schematic diagram of the EML modules: The figure below shows EML as a hierarchy. An EML document contains a dataset module that allows the grouping of one or more data entities (e.g. a file) linked together by particular rules to form a Data Package. The project module places the dataset that is being documented into its larger research context, and allows multiple related Data Packages to be linked. Motivation/Justification The backend uses a web2py database app, and R helper functions written by Ivan Hanigan There is a need for a data inventory tool to enable ecological data collections to be managed more efficiently The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) provides an excellent standardised schema for metadata, but the associated software Morpho does not have the flexibility or extensibility that would enable a data manager to use it to manage large and heterogeneous data collections KNB is a subproject of Ecoinformatics.org (http://ecoinformatics.org/) an open source collaboration that aims to produce software, systems, and services primarily for the ecological sciences. We apply these to Human Ecology systems too. XML A minimal EML document is summarised below. This is a schematic view that shows the structure of an EML XML document. Only a few of the possible components are included. In the graphic above the mandatory component of the EML is shown as a firm line, in contrast with those aspects of the EML which are not mandatory (dotted lines). That is: dataset title, creator and contact are the only required elements for a valid EML Data Package. &lt;eml&gt; &lt;dataset&gt; &lt;title&gt; &lt;creator&gt; &lt;contact&gt; &lt;project&gt; &lt;title&gt; &lt;personnel&gt; &lt;role&gt; &lt;abstract&gt; &lt;funding&gt; &lt;studyAreaDescription&gt; &lt;designDescription&gt; &lt;relatedProject&gt; &lt;associatedParty&gt; &lt;publisher&gt; &lt;pubDate&gt; &lt;keywords&gt; &lt;abstract&gt; &lt;intellectualright&gt; &lt;methods&gt; &lt;coverage&gt; &lt;dataTable&gt; &lt;entityName&gt; &lt;entityDescription&gt; &lt;physical&gt; &lt;attribute&gt; &lt;additionalMetadata&gt; &lt;additionalLinks&gt; The parts of an EML document In EML, the term dataset is applied to a document which may contain general information such as the title, creator, and contacts, abstract and keywords as well as one or more data entities, such as datatables, that provide more specific research details. The information is at the level of a particular data collection or study, however there is also a level above this at the project level where research studies can be grouped together. In EML, the term dataset refers to one or more data entities. However, there is no generally accepted practice on what to include in an EML-dataset document. Some people will choose to have a one-to-one correspondence between an EML document and a data entity and a single physical file. Others will document several data entities in one dataset document. Below is a brief description of the way we interpret the components of an EML dataset Datasets Dataset is the top level of the EML. The miminum necessary to produce a valid EML document is &lt;title&gt;, &lt;creator&gt;, &lt;contract&gt;. But one cant tell very much with just a title and a name. Our aim is to create an EML document that contains enough information about the data and research to make funding agencies happy and give other ecologists something to work with. Datasets may include one or more data entities such as data tables and spatial images along with associated metadata, but inclusion of data entities are not mandatory. The dataset module enables entities which are linked together to be grouped logically. LTERN groups entities into a single dataset using a range of integrity constraints such as the use of a specific sampling structure or monitoring theme employed over a discrete temporal and geographic range. In the context of the work undertaken by the LTERN Data Portal Team, the term dataset is sometimes used interchangeably with the term data package, however it should be recognised that these are not exactly the same. The dataset module is a part of an EML document which forms the basis for a data package. In EML, the dataset tag contains general information about a dataset; at minimum this must comprise a title, one Data Creator and a contact (often the Data Creator and contact will be the same). Additional information such as abstract, temporal coverage, keywords, geographic coverage and methods are used to provide context for the published or archived data packages. For more information about the general EML descriptions see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-resource.html For more detailed information about the EML-dataset module see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-dataset.html Projects The project module is optional, but in many cases highly desirable as this provides an overall description of the larger-scale project or research context with which that dataset is associated. For example it might be an entire Longterm Ecological Research Network (LTER) site, or an individual project at an LTER site. The EML project module of the EML enables data packages to be grouped logically together. The project module is primarily used by LTERN to identify the Data Owner and the source of funding. The project module is recursive in that it provides an overall description of the larger-scale project or research context for the specific project with which that data package is associated. Information in the project tag of the EML include detailed descriptions of the aims and objectives of the research, funding sources, personnel and a description of the study area. This module also includes content on the study and sampling design and the methods employed during the research. As an example, a project might comprise an entire Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTERN) plot network or an individual project at an LTERN site. For more information about the EML-dataset module see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-project.html Data Entity As stated earlier, a dataset consists of one or more data entities, and the most common data entity is a dataTable. A data table is something that looks like a matrix with rows for observations and columns for variables In addition to datatables, people using database applications may also produce a view from a database management system or a storedProcedure that results in data output. People using GIS (geographical information system) applications generate both spatialVector, also referred to as boundary or shape files, and spatialRaster. A spatialRaster is a geo-referenced image usually produced by a camera on a satellite or other remote sensing device. The final kind of data entity is otherEntity. An otherEntity is a data entity that cannot be represented by any of the previously defined data entity structures. A non-geo-referenced photograph is an otherEntity, e.g., a photograph of two different types of butterflies. For more information about types of EML-entities see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/#N10115 Attributes An attribute or as it is sometime referred to, variable, in this context refers to the name of the column of a datatable For more information about the EML dataTable type (especially its attributes) see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-dataTable.html#attribute "],["datasets-overview.html", "1.1 Datasets Overview", " 1.1 Datasets Overview Provision status categories: Identified, Requested, Provided, Published, TBC "],["abs-customised-for-apmma.html", "2 ABS_customised_for_APMMA", " 2 ABS_customised_for_APMMA metadata_field title ABS_customised_for_APMMA personnel_data_owner Guy Marks project_abstract Collected and customised from ABS data sources for the APMMA project "],["abs-sei-2006-2016.html", "2.1 abs_sei_2006_2016", " 2.1 abs_sei_2006_2016 metadata_field shortname abs_sei_2006_2016 title abs_sei_2006_2016 creator Various contact_email car.data@sydney.edu.au abstract Put together by Cassandra to represent parts of SEIFA for use in APMMA health modelling additional_metadata NOT YET PUBLISHED alternate_identifier associated_party access_rules Recommended Citation licence_code No licence accessibility "],["apmma-abs-mb.html", "2.2 apmma_abs_mb", " 2.2 apmma_abs_mb metadata_field shortname apmma_abs_mb title apmma_abs_mb creator Various contact_email car.data@sydney.edu.au abstract This is combinations of MB categories for APMMA AP modelling: % coverage in buffer where ABS 2016 MB category was Commercial or Education or Medical/Hospital % coverage in buffer where ABS 2016 MB category was residential % coverage in buffer where ABS 2016 MB category was open space (the sum of water ,other, agricultural land). % coverage in buffer where ABS 2016 MB category was industrial.

Assessment of the impacts of air pollution on population health and evaluation of trends relative to other major risk factors requires regularly updated, accurate, spatially resolved exposure estimates. We combined satellite-based estimates, chemical transport model simulations, and ground measurements from 79 different countries to produce global estimates of annual average fine particle (PM2.5) and ozone concentrations at 0.1Â° Ã 0.1Â° spatial resolution for five-year intervals from 1990 to 2010 and the year 2013. These estimates were applied to assess population-weighted mean concentrations for 1990-2013 for each of 188 countries. (See Environ. Sci.

These data are from DustTrack monitors, not Standard Australian equipment and their readings should be considered indicative only. Data has been downloaded using the NSW DPIE API. Instruments used: Multi-channel DustTraks are used for stations reporting TSP, PM10 and PM2.5. Single-channel DustTraks are used for stations reporting TSP only. An ongoing upgrade is underway to replace all NSW sites with multi-channel instruments. Disclaimer: Most rural network stations use mid-cost indicative monitors which respond to all aerosols including dust, sea salt and smoke. Single-channel DustTraks (TSP only) will also respond to fog. Best efforts have been made to ensure that data from these instruments is consistent with measurements from compliance instruments. However, note that instrument accuracy does not meet strict Australian Standards, therefore care must be taken in interpreting the data compared with Air NEPM standards without additional information. Reported data has only undergone preliminary automated checks, and further manual validation is performed for data stored in the DPIE database. Data is reported in Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST).

The dataset does not contain names but has a number of attributes of an individual including the International Classification of Disease (currently version 10) codes relating to the causes of death, which are added by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The national dataset is a compilation of death records from each of the State and Territory Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages (RBDMs) and from State and Chief Coroners through the National Coronial Information System (NCIS). Subsets of the national data will be available by individual or multiple jurisdictions. The COD URF is used for demographic and health purposes. Research from this data provides significant information for the formulation and monitoring of health and other social policies. For a full list of the data items included in the COD URF refer to: What data items are included in the COD URF? Note: The data available is coded to ICD-10, not ICD-10-AM. These data require an extensive application process including ethics approval and involve heavy fees. Additionally, each project requires its own application.

The grids show the heating &amp; cooling degree days values across Australia in the form of a two-dimensional array. The mean data are based on the standard 30-year period 1961-1990. Heating and cooling degree days are based on the average daily temperature. The average daily temperature is calculated as follows: [maximum daily temperature + minimum daily temperature] / 2. If the average daily temperature falls below comfort levels, heating is required; and if it is above comfort levels, cooling is required. The heating degree days or cooling degree days are determined by the difference between the average daily temperature and the comfort level temperature. The comfort level values used are 12 and 18 degrees Celsius for heating and 18 and 24 degrees Celsius for cooling. For example, if heating is being considered to a temperature comfort level of 18 degrees, and the average daily temperature for a particular location was 14 degrees, then heating equivalent to 4 degrees (4 heating degree days) would be required to maintain a temperature of 18 degrees for that day. However if the average daily temperature was 20 degrees then no heating would be required, so the number of heating degree days for that day would be zero. If cooling is being considered to a temperature comfort level of 24 degrees, and if the average temperature for a day was 27 degrees, then cooling equivalent to 3 degrees (3 cooling degree days) would be required to maintain a temperature of 24 degrees for that day. However if the average temperature was 21 degrees, then no cooling would be required, so the number of cooling degree days for that day would be zero. Average annual heating and cooling degree days are calculated by adding heating and cooling degree days totals over a specified period (1961 to 1990) and dividing by the number of years in that period (30 years in this case). Similarly, average monthly heating and cooling degree days are calculated by adding monthly totals and dividing by the number of years in the specified period.

Average annual RH is calculated by adding (9am or) 3pm RH values over a specified period (1976 - 2005) and dividing by the number of years in that period (30 years in this case). Similarly, average monthly (9am and) 3pm RH is calculated by adding daily (9am or) 3pm values for a selected month and dividing by the number of years in the specified period. Relative humidity (RH) is an indicator of the moisture content of the air. It is the amount of moisture in the air as a percentage of the amount of moisture the air can actually contain. Warmer air can contain more moisture than cooler air, which means that for a given amount of atmospheric moisture, RH will be lower if the air is warm and higher if the air is cool. This can be seen by comparing the daily 9am maps (higher RH values) with the daily 3pm maps (lower RH values) for any month of the year. The annual 9am and 3pm RH maps show that RH increases in coastal regions, similar in nature to the distribution of rainfall in the annual rainfall maps. RH tends to be higher in northern Australia due to the wet climate experienced in this region. additional_metadata /home/public_share_data/ResearchData_CAR/Environment_General/Climate_and_weather_BOM/average_3pm_relative_humidity_1976_2005 alternate_identifier https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/f/5545082383 associated_party access_rules Recommended Citation Australian Bureau of Meteorology, 2016.

More information available here: http://www.globalfiredata.org/fireatlas.html The Global Fire Atlas of individual fire size, duration, speed and direction Andela et al. (2019) The Global Fire Atlas is a new freely available global dataset that tracks the daily dynamics of individual fires to determine the timing and location of ignitions, fire size and duration, and daily expansion, fire line length, speed, and direction of spread. Data are available in easily accessible GIS-layers and can also be explored online here and a detailed description of the underlying methodology is provided by Andela et al. (2019). The data provide unique insights in the environmental conditions that give rise to the worlds most extreme wildfires. The worlds largest wildfires were found in sparsely populated arid and semiarid grasslands and shrublands of interior Australia, Africa, and Central Asia. Strikingly, fires of these proportions were nearly absent in similar ecosystems of North and South America, possibly due to higher landscape fragmentation and different management practices, including active fire suppression. While the worlds largest fires occurred in more arid ecosystems, the longest fires burned for over 2 months in seasonal regions of the humid tropics and high-latitude forests. In these sparsely populated high fuel-load systems fires can continuously burn as long as weather conditions are favorable. Abnormal weather conditions often synchronized the occurrence of multiple extreme wildfires across larger regions. Global patterns of fire velocity were reversely related to fuel loads, and the highest fire velocities typically occurred in areas of low fuel loads. additional_metadata /home/public_share_data/ResearchData_CAR/Environment_General/Global_Fire_Emissions_Database/Global_Fire_Atlas_NSW_2003_2020 alternate_identifier https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/f/5031227159 associated_party access_rules Recommended Citation Andela, N. 2020.

In generating this monthly product, the algorithm ingests all the MOD13A2 products that overlap the month and employs a weighted temporal average. The MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAAs Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products and provides continuity for time series historical applications. MODIS also includes an Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are computed from surface reflectances corrected for molecular scattering, ozone absorption, and aerosols. Vegetation indices are used for global monitoring of vegetation conditions and are used in products displaying land cover and land cover changes. These data may be used as input for modeling global biogeochemical and hydrologic processes as well as global and regional climate. Additional applications include characterizing land surface biophysical properties and processes, such as primary production and land cover conversion. Provided along with the vegetation layers and the two quality assurance (QA) layers are reflectance bands 1 (red), 2 (near-infrared), 3 (blue), and 7 (mid-infrared), as well as three observation layers. additional_metadata /home/public_share_data/ResearchData_CAR/Environment_General/NDVI_MODIS/MOD13A3_006_Terra_NDVI_2000_2020 alternate_identifier https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/f/5898883589 associated_party access_rules Recommended Citation Didan, K.

Using the very precise air quality monitors installed around Sydney, along with sophisticated modelling by the collaborators, we are gaining insights that other studies have missed about the lower levels of NO2 exposure. Weâve been able to produce the best maps so far of air pollution for Sydney, and the scale is down to a hundred metres or so. Previous analysis used scales of several kilometres, These new maps are much closer to the level of detail needed to accurately determine health impacts and plan for the future.

The geometry for road and rail lines was based on the centreline of these roads / rail with arbitrary values based on road or rail classification. Eg 75 dB for freeways and stepping down in 5 dB increments for each drop in road classification. For buildings, the cadastral boundaries that were residential and created a polygon within a few meters or so away from the cadastral line. Then the 2011 Mesh Block and Census data were used. A population estimate was attached to each building based on the volume of the building (ie building footprint area * the height), as to assign a greater number of people to larger, taller buildings (eg unit blocks) compare to single dwellings. Then a noise level was calculated for each building for the road lines. These noise levels are based on the noise levels around each building facade and provide not only the maximum noise level at each building, but also an average and minimum noise levels around each building, acknowledging not everyone lives in the loudest room of each house. This data is a based on a crude model with the greatest limitation being the estimated building facade information based on block size and a nominal setback distance to define the footprint. additional_metadata Access is restricted alternate_identifier https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/f/3751667240 associated_party access_rules Recommended Citation Hinze, B.

For roads, inputs based from mobile device probe counts include traffic volumes, speeds and HGV% for the day, evening and night time periods for all roads including local access streets. Noise barriers as identified by the NSW Department of Roads and Maritime Services also feature. Buildings were sourced from PSMA Australia (release date May 2019), with all features overlaid on to a terrain developed from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. Noise levels in the form of an LAeq were calculated using the German standard RLS90 for the day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm) and night (11pm to 7am) time periods. At this stage, no verification has been made with this dataset and the German standard. This process is currently underway. Then a noise level was calculated for each facade of each storey for each building for the road lines. These noise levels are based on the noise levels around each building facade and provide not only the maximum noise level at each building, but also an average and minimum noise levels around each building, acknowledging not everyone lives in the loudest room of each house.

NSW Health encourages all public water suppliers to regularly report water quality information to their consumers. Water quality information is also published annually in the NSW Department of Industry Waterâs Water Supply and Sewerage Performance Monitoring Reports. Water quality incidents Occasionally incidents affect drinking water quality. These may include changing source water conditions such as flooding, operational problems, detection of Escherichia coli bacteria and/or blooms of cyanobacteria (blue green algae). The NSW Health response protocols provide guidance on managing physical, chemical and microbiological quality of drinking water and/or treatment failure. Water suppliers in consultation with their local Public Health Unit may issue a boil water alert or other warnings to protect the health of consumers. Water suppliers are responsible for ensuring that consumers are aware of any warnings regarding the safety of drinking water. This can be achieved using a variety of media such as newspapers, radio and social media. Letter drops, warning signs and direct contact with vulnerable populations may also be required. additional_metadata /home/public_share_data/ResearchData_CAR/Environment_General/NSW_Dept_of_Health/Drinking_water_quality_and_incidents alternate_identifier https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/f/3944940840 associated_party access_rules Recommended Citation NSW Ministry of Health, 2019.

HVI utilises indicators for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to calculate an overall heat vulnerability index. Expressed through the data, a vulnerability of 1 represents a combination of low exposure, low sensitivity and/or high adaptive capacity. A vulnerability of 5 represents high exposure, high sensitivity and/or low adaptive capacity. The calculation of HVI and the inputs to the exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators are explained in the metadata. The HVI data is aggregated to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) polygon dataset to enable spatial analysis to support local policy and decision making. It can be used in conjunction with the NSW urban vegetation cover dataset for the same time period for broader analysis of the relationship of heat to green cover.

The original analysis of climate data in the Sydney GMR was conducted by Behnoosh Khalaj and Keith Dear for their paper Khalaj, B., Lloyd, G., Sheppeard, V., &amp; Dear, K. (2010). The health impacts of heat waves in five regions of New South Wales, Australia: a case-only analysis. International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health, 83(7), 833â842. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-010-0534-2 The study focused on five regions in NSW: Sydney East; Sydney West; Gosford- Wyong; Newcastle and Illawarra. Cooler nights in Sydney West and cooler days in Sydney East provided the rationale for dividing Sydney into East and West. Data from Sydney weather stations were used to define two temperature regions (Sydney West and Sydney East) by maximising the ratio of between groups to within- group temperature variance. Statistical local areas (SLA) within Sydney were then assigned to the west and east regions. SLA of residence was used to assign patients to Sydney East, Sydney West, Illawarra, Gosford-Wyong and Newcastle. The average of weather and air pollution observations from all monitoring stations in each region was used. Subsequently Ivan Hanigan based the creation of a new spatial dataset for the Biomass Smoke and Human Health collaboration that included many other cities and towns. That derived dataset contains all the other cities and towns from the biomass smoke and health project, stored at Environment_General/Biomass_Smoke_Validated_Events/biosmoke_spatial/data_provided on the UCRH Q drive. This current sydney GMR dataset is a subset of that biomass smoke project study regions dataset created by Hanigan, and just shows the Sydney GMR. These data (and the map from Khalaj et al 2010) was also used in the Wilson heat paper: Wilson, L. A. L. A., Gerard Morgan, G., Hanigan, I. C. I. C., Johnston, F. F.

Data includes averages per year and per season (summer, autumn, winter and spring). These data are downloaded from http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/climate_averages/uv-index/index.jsp?period=a where they are used by BOM to create heat maps of solar radiation. These maps show the average annual, monthly and seasonal values of the UV Index over Australia for the period 1979-2007 under cloud-free conditions at local noon, when the sun is at its highest. These values are also representative of the values expected between 11 am and 1 pm local time (12 pm and 2 pm daylight saving time) under clear skies. The UV Index provides a simple measure of the solar UV radiation level at the earths surface and thereby the potential for skin damage. Values can vary from zero upwards - the higher the value the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eye, and the less time it takes for harm to occur. Protective measures need to be taken for UV Index values of 3 or above. The patterns of average monthly clear-sky UV Index largely follow latitude lines with the highest values generally in the north of the continent and the lowest in the south. The Index reaches a peak in January when average values of 11 or more cover virtually all of Australia. These values are clear-sky values only, conditions would otherwise be somewhat tempered by the cloudiness associated with the monsoon in the north. The lowest values occur in June-July where the UV Index averages less than 2 over Tasmania, increasing to almost 8-9 in far northern Australia. It is the varying intensity of solar radiation and ozone throughout the year that mostly accounts for this variation of the UV Index which is evident on the monthly and seasonal maps.

Data created by Geoscience Australia. See http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/25/5539DFE87D895 for more information. Geoscience Australia has the primary role in the delineation of Australias domestic and international maritime limits and boundaries. An output of this activity is the development of the Australian Maritime Boundaries (AMB) data. AMB is a GIS data product, replacing Australian Maritime Boundaries 2014 (AMB2014), providing access to the data for Australias maritime zones. AMB is a digital representation of Australias limits and boundaries as established under the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 and associated proclamations. The data also include a representation of the limits by which the scheduled and offshore areas of each of the States and of the Northern Territory are determined under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 (OPGGSA). In the event of an inconsistency between AMB data and the limits under any legislation, the latter prevails. The data have been published by Geoscience Australia in consultation with other relevant Commonwealth Government agencies including the Attorney-Generals Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Australian Hydrographic Office. This version contains a number of technical amendments made on the basis of user feedback. These include: Â· Harmonisation of maritime boundaries, scheduled area and graticular block datasets in block SC51 AMB data comprise the territorial straight baselines and the outer limits of each zone, together with maritime boundaries determined by treaties between Australia and neighbouring countries. All data coordinates are supplied in the GDA94 datum. The data reflects the location of the coastline within the constraints of available source material at the time of production. AMB Data can also be viewed on-line via AMSIS (http://www.ga.gov.au/marine/jurisdiction/amsis.html). Product Specifications Coverage: Australia including all external territories Currency: May 2014. Coordinates: Geographical Datum: GDA94 (functionally equivalent to WGS84). Format: ESRI Geodatabase and REST web service - free online. The area of coverage of the AMB data is for the whole of the Australian marine jurisdiction which includes waters adjacent to the mainland, offshore islands and External Territories. The geographical extent is approximately between the latitude limits of 7 S to 70 S and the longitude limits 40 E to 175 E. additional_metadata /home/public_share_data/ResearchData_CAR/Environment_General/Water_bodies_GA/Australian_maritime_boundaries_2014 alternate_identifier https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/f/5562626799 associated_party access_rules Recommended Citation licence_code CCBY accessibility CAR "],["surface-hydrology-ga-2019.html", "162.2 Surface_Hydrology_GA_2019", " 162.2 Surface_Hydrology_GA_2019 metadata_field shortname Surface_Hydrology_GA_2019 title Surface_Hydrology_GA_2019 creator Crossman, S. &amp; Li, O. contact_email car.data@sydney.edu.au abstract ARCGis files showing national surface water, downloaded from: http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/dataset/ga/83135 (national) This dataset represents Australias surface hydrology at a national scale.
